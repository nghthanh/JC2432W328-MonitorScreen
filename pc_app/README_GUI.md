2. Click **Get Device Status**
3. View complete device information

## Detailed Features

### Monitor Tab

**Connection Modes:**
- **WiFi**: Recommended for desktop monitoring (default)
- **BLE**: For Bluetooth Low Energy connection (coming soon)

**Live Metrics:**
- CPU usage percentage with visual progress bar
- CPU temperature in Celsius
- Memory usage percentage and progress bar
- Disk usage percentage and progress bar
- Network upload/download speeds in KB/s

**Update Interval:**
- Configurable from 1 to 60 seconds
- Faster updates = more responsive display
- Slower updates = less network/CPU usage

### Device Configuration

**WiFi Setup:**
1. Click "Scan WiFi" to see available networks
2. Enter SSID and password
3. Click "Set WiFi"
4. Device will restart automatically

**Display Customization:**
- **Theme 0 (Default)**: Progress bars with detailed information
- **Theme 1 (Minimal)**: Large numbers, clean layout
- **Theme 2 (Graph)**: Historical data visualization
- **Theme 3 (Compact)**: Dense information with mini graphs

**Date/Time Options:**
- **Manual**: Set specific date and time
- **NTP**: Automatically sync with internet time servers
  - Supports timezone offset configuration
  - Configurable NTP server (default: pool.ntp.org)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- CPU Temperature High (¬∞C)
- Memory Low (%)
- Disk Low (%)

### Serial Communication

The GUI uses serial communication to send CLI commands to your ESP32 device. This allows you to:
- Configure WiFi without using the Serial Monitor
- Change display settings instantly
- Set date/time and sync with NTP
- View device status in a friendly format
- Reset device to factory defaults

**Serial Connection Tips:**
- Ensure no other programs (like Arduino Serial Monitor) are using the port
- If connection fails, try clicking "Refresh" to update the port list
- On some systems, you may need administrator privileges

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`: Switch between tabs
- `F5`: Refresh serial ports (when in Device Config tab)

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start

**Error: "No module named PyQt5"**
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

**Error: "No module named serial"**
```bash
pip install pyserial
```

### Serial Connection Issues

**Port not listed:**
- Install USB-to-Serial drivers for your ESP32 board
- Check that ESP32 is connected via USB
- Click "Refresh" to update port list

**Connection failed:**
- Close Arduino IDE Serial Monitor if open
- Try a different USB port
- Restart the ESP32 device

**No response to commands:**
- Verify ESP32 is running the correct firmware
- Check baudrate is 115200 (default)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Monitoring Issues

**"Failed to start monitoring":**
- Verify ESP32 IP address is correct
- Check that ESP32 is connected to WiFi
- Ensure port 8080 (or configured port) is accessible
- Check firewall settings on PC

**No data showing:**
- Verify ESP32 is receiving data (check its display)
- Ensure WiFi mode is selected if using WiFi
- Check network connectivity
- Try using the command-line client first to verify connection

**Data stops updating:**
- Check ESP32 is still powered on
- Verify network connection is stable
- Check the Activity Log for error messages
- Try stopping and restarting monitoring

### Display/Configuration Issues

**Commands not working:**
- Ensure serial connection is established (button shows "Disconnect")
- Check Response area for error messages
- Verify ESP32 is responding (try "Get Device Status")

**WiFi setup fails:**
- Use quotes for SSIDs with spaces (automatically handled by GUI)
- Verify password is correct
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check Response area for specific error messages

## Advanced Usage

### Running as Background Process

You can minimize the GUI and it will continue monitoring in the background.

### Multiple Instances

You can run multiple instances to monitor different ESP32 devices:
1. Start first instance, configure for device #1
2. Start second instance, configure for device #2
3. Each instance operates independently

### Automation with Scripts

While the GUI is running, you can still use the command-line `monitor_client.py` for automation or scripting purposes.

## Known Limitations

- BLE mode not yet implemented in GUI (use command-line client)
- Serial connection requires exclusive access (close other serial programs)
- Windows may require administrator privileges for serial access
- Live data updates limited to WiFi mode

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] BLE mode support
- [ ] Multiple device monitoring in single window
- [ ] Data logging and export (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Historical data graphs
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Auto-reconnect on connection loss
- [ ] Device discovery (auto-find ESP32 on network)
- [ ] Custom alert notifications
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Serial Configuration**: Use the GUI's serial connection feature to configure your ESP32 once, then disconnect and use WiFi monitoring for normal operation.

2. **Network Stability**: For best results, use a wired Ethernet connection on your PC or ensure strong WiFi signal.

3. **Update Interval**: Start with 1-second intervals for testing, increase to 2-5 seconds for normal use to reduce network traffic.

4. **Firewall**: If monitoring fails, temporarily disable firewall or add exception for Python/this application.

5. **First-Time Setup**: Connect via serial first to configure WiFi, then switch to wireless monitoring.
